  <h1>For the Ramp Rats</h1>
  <p>
    This one’s for the crew--the ones who ran toward the noise, braved the chaos, and held the line when nobody else could.  
    You made the impossible feel routine, and even on the roughest days, I knew I wasn’t alone.  
    I never said it loud enough: thank you.

We weren’t born in the same town
Didn’t grow up on the same ground
But we showed up when the planes flew
And made a crew outta Mamadou's

Coffee in hand, ice in the wind
Laughed at pain, soaked to the skin
And if one of us was fallin’ through
We’d drop the world just to pull ‘em through

And I’d do it all again
For the crew I ran with
The ones who’d bleed and grin
In the darkest shifts
We moved like fire, we held that line
No glory, just grit, just give it your spine
I was proud--so damn proud--to be part of them
Right to the end

There were names I never knew
But I’d trust ‘em with more than a few
Cause you don’t need titles when it’s go-time
Just a nod, a glove, and shared grind

We knew the weight of every cart
The dance it took to tear apart
A plane and build it whole again
Before the sun could crack the bend

And I’d do it all again
For the crew I ran with
The ones who’d bleed and grin
In the darkest shifts
We moved like fire, we held that line
No glory, just grit, just give it your spine
I was proud--so proud--to be part of them
Until I was done

You don’t forget that kind of bond
When the job is over, the work goes on
In the bones, in the back, in the little scars
In the way you still check the stars

I was never more alive than when I was just one of them
Shiddy Doo… not in charge. Just in it.
And we held that gate like no one else could.

Fourteen eighty-six--yeah, I kept the count
Each one logged, no need to mount
The stories high, or boast too loud
I did my work, I made ’em proud

Never dumped, not once in shame
The hoses coiled, the badge, the name
They called me Shiddy Doo, with a crooked grin
But I never let the mess win

But I won’t make fifteen hundred
Though I could, you see
The line’s just close enough
To mean somethin’ deep to me
Some men chase their glory
I’ve had enough of the climb
So I’ll leave with fourteen eighty- six
And the rest stays mine

There’s a brotherhood out on the ramp
Steel-toed boots in the frozen damp
No medals there, but trust runs deep
In every tug, every cargo sweep

I’ve worked with kings who’ll never kneel
Who feel the cold, but not the steel
To every Ramp Agent I stood beside--
You kept me strong, you fed my pride

But I won’t make fifteen hundred
That bell won’t chime
I’m leavin’ with my legacy
And a clean behind
Some folks count the service
Some just know when to go
Shiddy Doo’s clockin’ out
With nothin’ left to show…

Maybe I could’ve stayed, maybe earned that win
But pride ain’t in the number
It’s in the way you grin
When the tank is drained, the job is done
And nobody saw you run

So tell ’em I was there, and I did it right
Every tank, every storm, every bitter night
Fourteen eighty-six, never spilled a drop
And I knew just when to stop

"Shiddy Doo … out."
