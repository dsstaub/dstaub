  <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Interview Questions (Answered by Me)</h1>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">Before we even sit down, here’s how I think, work, and show up. Saves us both time, right?</p>

  <div class="qa">
    <div class="question">Q: Tell me about yourself.</div>
    <div class="answer">A: I’m a creative ops minded worker who codes tools and/or seeks real-world solutions to solve real-world problems. I've worked on tarmacs and in terminal windows, in retail and in kitchens, in construction and warehousing, and I bring speed, clarity, and a no-BS attitude to everything I build.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: Why do you want this role?</div>
    <div class="answer">A: Because I’m done settling. I’ve already built half of what companies pay consultants for. I've consistently built or maintained quality teams that drive results. I want to contribute somewhere that values sharp execution and autonomy.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: What’s your biggest strength?</div>
    <div class="answer">A: I make things intuitive and fast. Whether it’s operations or streamlining processes, I think like the customer, build like an engineer, and test like a cynic.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: What’s a weakness you’re working on?</div>
    <div class="answer">A: Impatience. I don’t like inefficiency. I’ve learned to channel that into streamlining systems, and demonstrating their usefulness in real-world situations, instead of steamrolling people.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: Tell me about a challenge you overcame.</div>
    <div class="answer">A: On the ramp, I once had five aircraft inbound within ten minutes and broken equipment. I organized a manual workaround and then built a digital tool later that would've helped me plan a better way to approach it, utilizing quality data and other helpful infomation. That became a prototype I continued to use.</div>
