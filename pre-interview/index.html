        Before we even sit down, here’s how I think, work, and show up.<br> Saves us both time, right?
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-base">
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-400">Q: Tell me about yourself.</p>
          <p>A: I’m a creative ops minded worker who codes tools and/or seeks real-world solutions to solve real-world problems. I've worked on tarmacs and in terminal windows, in retail and in kitchens, in construction and warehousing, and I bring speed, clarity, and a no-BS attitude to everything I build.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-green-400">Q: Why do you want this role?</p>
          <p>A: Because I’m done settling. I’ve already built half of what companies pay consultants for. I've consistently built or maintained quality teams that drive results. I want to contribute somewhere that values sharp execution and autonomy.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Q: What’s your biggest strength?</p>
          <p>A: I make things intuitive and fast. Whether it’s operations or streamlining processes, I think like the customer, build like an engineer, and test like a cynic.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">Q: What’s a weakness you’re working on?</p>
          <p>A: Impatience. I don’t like inefficiency. I’ve learned to channel that into streamlining systems, and demonstrating their usefulness in real-world situations, instead of steamrolling people.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-400">Q: Tell me about a challenge you overcame.</p>
          <p>A: On the ramp, I once had five aircraft inbound within ten minutes and broken equipment. I organized a manual workaround and then built a digital tool later that would've helped me plan a better way to approach it, utilizing quality data and other helpful infomation. That became a prototype I continued to use.</p>
