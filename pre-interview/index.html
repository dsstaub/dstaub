        Before we even sit down, here’s how I think, work, and show up.<br> Saves us both time, right?
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-base">
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-400">Q: Tell me about yourself.</p>
          <p>A: "I’m an operations-minded problem solver who thrives on finding real solutions to real-world challenges. I’ve worked on tarmacs and in terminal windows, in retail aisles and construction zones -- and everywhere I’ve been, I’ve brought speed, clarity, and a no-nonsense mindset. Whether leading a team or building a workaround, I focus on what works and what moves people forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-green-400">Q: Why do you want this role?</p>
          <p>A: Because I’m done settling. I’ve already built tools and systems that companies pay consultants to deliver -- and I’ve done it from the ground up. I’ve consistently led or supported high-performing teams that deliver results. I’m looking for a role where sharp execution and autonomy are valued, and where leadership respects both individual strengths and team-driven impact -- no matter the position I’m in.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-blue-400">Q: What’s your biggest strength?</p>
          <p>A: I make things intuitive and fast. Whether it’s operations or process improvement, I think like the end user, build like an engineer, and test like a skeptic. Every decision I make is about clarity, speed, and solving the real problem -- not just the surface one. If you've heard of the '5 Whys', you get me already.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">Q: What’s a weakness you’re working on?</p>
          <p>A: Impatience, at times. I’m wired to spot inefficiencies quickly, but I’ve learned to redirect that energy into building better systems and workflows. My focus now is on supporting teams with tools and processes that make their work smoother, faster, and more rewarding.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-400">Q: Tell me about a challenge you overcame.</p>
          <p>A: On the ramp, I once had five aircraft inbound within ten minutes -- and broken equipment. I quickly organized a manual workaround to get the job done safely and efficiently. After the shift, I built a digital planning tool that used real-time data to help visualize workload and optimize timing. That prototype became something I refined and relied on regularly.</p>
