      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-green-400">How to *Be* in an Interview</h1>
      <p class="text-center text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 italic">
        It’s not just what you say -- it’s how you say it, how you show up, and what you leave behind.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-base">

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-400">1. Be Confident, Not Cocky</p>
          <p>Sit up, make eye contact, and speak clearly. Confidence is calm, measured, and prepared. Cockiness is loud, defensive, and insecure. They can tell the difference--so show up as someone who knows their value but doesn’t need to brag about it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-blue-400">2. Be the Problem-Solver, Not the Hero</p>
          <p>Use "we" when describing team success. Use "I" when describing your contribution. Show how you think, how you adapt, and how you help people win. Nobody’s looking for a solo act--they’re looking for someone who makes the team better.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">3. Use Language That Shows You’re Sharp</p>
          <p>Say things like:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>"Here’s how I approached it…"</li>
              <li>"One thing I learned from that experience…"</li>
              <li>"What mattered most in that moment was…"</li>
              <li>"I’d measure success by…"</li>
            </ul>
            These show you’re reflective, intentional, and results-oriented.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-purple-400">4. Match Their Energy</p>
          <p>If they’re formal, be crisp and professional. If they’re casual, be warm and personable. Mirror their tone--but always stay true to you. Let your personality through without being overly familiar or stiff.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-pink-500">5. Don’t Dodge the Tough Questions</p>
          <p>Own your gaps, failures, or past decisions with clarity and responsibility. No one’s perfect. What they want to hear is how you handled it and what you learned. Say: "Here’s what I took from that experience and how I’ve applied it since."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-indigo-400">6. Keep Answers Tight</p>
          <p>1–2 minutes max per answer. If they want more, they’ll ask. Rambling signals a lack of clarity or prep. Stay focused. Structure your answers like mini-stories--context, action, result.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-teal-500">7. End Strong</p>
          <p>When they ask "Any questions for us?" don’t say "Nope." Ask one thoughtful thing about the team, the work, or their biggest goal for the year. Then end with: "Thanks again for your time. This conversation has only confirmed my interest in the role."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-zinc-400">The Vibe You Want to Leave Behind</p>
          <p>"That person has it together."  
          "They’d hit the ground running."  
          "They’d be easy to work with and tough to compete against."  
          Be that person. Then let the rest fall where it may.</p>
